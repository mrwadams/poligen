## A multi-agent chat inferface for generating cybersecurity policies

PoliGen is a multi-agent chat interface for generating cybersecurity policies. It is designed to be used by non-experts in cybersecurity, to help them generate policies that are tailored to their specific needs.

The tool uses an OpenAI [GPT model](https://openai.com/product#gpt) in combination with [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) - a multi-agent conversation framework for building Large Language Model (LLM) workflows. Together, they allow users to simply specify the type of policy they need, and then have it generated by a team of AI agents. The user can also participate in the conversation, providing feedback and guidance to the agents to improve the quality of the generated policy.
